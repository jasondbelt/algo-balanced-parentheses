# Balanced Parentheses

For this assignment, we will do it on leetcode. This is both to help you get more familiar with leetcode (which is becoming a standard tool in the technical interview-prep process) and because leetcode describes this problem particularly well and has excellent tests for it.

**You should complete the assignment in leetcode above, to get familiar with the platform.** That said, if it helps, don't be afraid to prototype code locally (on your own computer) in VS Code. 

If you have not we recommend creating free account with leetcode.

Below is the problem description from leetcode 

----

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

### Write an algorithm that takes in a string and returns a string with balanced parentheses only. The string will contain letters, numbers, and parentheses only.

```python
balanceParens("()") # should return "()"
balanceParens("a(b)c)") # should return "a(b)c"
balanceParens("(a)(bdd)c)") # should return "(a)(bdd)c"
balanceParens("a(dbvb)c)") # should return "a(dbvb)c"
balanceParens("a(b)(c)())") # should return "a(b)(c)()"
balanceParens(")(") # should return ""
balanceParens("(((((") # should return ""
balanceParens(")(())(") # should return "(())"
balanceParens("(()()(") # should return "()()"
balanceParens(")())(()()(") # should return "()()()"
```

### Challenge - Nested Parentheses
```python
balanceParens(")(())(")) # should return "(())"
```
